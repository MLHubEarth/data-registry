Name: Open Cities AI Challenge Dataset
Description: "This dataset was developed as part of a challenge to segment building footprints from aerial imagery. The goal of the challenge was to accelerate the development of more accurate, relevant, and usable open-source AI models to support mapping for disaster risk management in African cities. The data consists of drone imagery from 10 different cities and regions across Africa"
