Description: "The SpaceNet 7 Multi-Temporal Urban Development Challenge aims to help address this deficit and develop novel computer vision methods for non-video time series data.
<br><br>
In this challenge, participants will identify and track buildings in satellite imagery time series collected over rapidly urbanizing areas.
<br><br>
The competition centers around a new open source dataset of Planet satellite imagery mosaics, which includes 24 images (one per month) covering ~100 unique geographies."
