# Radiant MLHub Training Data Repository
 
This repository contains information on training datasets hosted on [Radiant MLHub](https://www.mlhub.earth/). Specification files in the [datasets](datasets/) folder populate [Radiant MLHub registry](http://registry.mlhub.earth/). The goal of this registry is to make it easy for everyone to explore datasets available on Radiant MLHub before accessing the API.
 
 
## How to contribute?
If you want to add resources to a dataset's registry (tutorials, publications, or tools) you are welcomed to update the specification YAML file in [datasets](datasets/) and submit and PR. Please follow the file structure in this [template](datasets/template.yaml).

## How to access the data?
Radiant MLHub is open-access. You can sign up on our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mlhub.earth/) and get your API access token to access the data. Check out several tutorials in [this repository](https://github.com/radiantearth/mlhub-tutorials) as well the [API documentation](http://docs.mlhub.earth/).
